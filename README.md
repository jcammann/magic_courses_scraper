# magic_courses_scraper
scraper for maths-magic.ac.uk lecture notes


I got to lazy downloading the lecture notes manually.


Replace email, pw (if you don't want to type it manually), semester and courses accordingly.

reload_all determines if existing files are downloaded again.

I am aware this is a mess, feel free to improve it.
